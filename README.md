# CSE3241-StomperWombat-Databas-Design

* Your group has been hired to design and implement the database portion of a major 
development effort for a large manufacturing company. This company, Stomper & Wombat’s, 
currently has no database systems, all current systems are file-based. The long-time president 
of the company has retired and left his son in charge. As Stomper & Wombat’s have 
experienced countless issues using the file-based systems, they have decided to switch to the 
database approach. 
 
* To accomplish this goal, they have retained your employer, VaporWare Consulting, to take 
responsibility of the database side of the new enterprise-wide suite of applications. Stomper & 
Wombat’s has a team of application developers who will develop the web-based applications. 
One database will support all of the functionality of these applications. Some of these 
applications are internal; only accessible by Stomper & Wombat’s employees. Some will be 
publically accessible. 
 
* What follows are narratives from different Stomper & Wombat’s employees who are 
attempting to describe how Stomper & Wombat’s is organized and how they operate. Any 
questions you have for any of these stakeholders are to be emailed to your instructor or grader 
but the content should be directed to the proper Stomper & Wombat’s employee.
